# Siemens DataBlock Extractor

One challenge I’ve faced during my Project is the lack of an easy, automated method to export Siemens PLC data blocks and convert all offsets into a single JSON file for Ignition SCADA integration., This simple tool designed to simplify the process of converting PLC Datablock data into JSON format for integration with Ignition OPC UA Server.

Main Interface.

:hammer_and_wrench: Key Features:

Effortless Data Handling: Imports and processes Name, Data Type, and Offset data all at once.
Automated Offset Conversion: Generates JSON for all offsets in one go—saving hours of manual effort!
SCADA Integration Ready: Outputs a fully compatible JSON file that can be imported directly into Ignition SCADA.
Steps For Operation.

Just Copy and Paste Details

As a training Automation Engineer, I’ve explored various tools that make certain tasks easier, but when it comes to exporting Siemens PLC data blocks and generating JSON files for Ignition SCADA, maybe tools exist that are easier than this—but I haven’t found any method simpler or more efficient than the one I’ve developed.

I believe in improving communities by helping others. Automation can be complex, and if my work can save someone time or make their tasks easier, that’s a win for me. Let’s grow together and make automation more accessible for everyone!
